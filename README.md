# resin-io-projects-ETANixieClock
This project takes the [ETANixieClock](https://wp.me/p85ddV-Ad) Raspberry pi project and converts it into a Resin-io (Resin-io was recently changed to Balena-io) Docker Device.  See the complete blog for this project at [Easy IoT Fleet Deployment of ETA Nixie Tube Clocks](https://surfncircuits.com/?p=2665).  The goal of the blog and project is to allow on the fly updates of the code along with a method to maintian persistant data when the code is updated.    It also includes a way to externally setup a wifi connection when a valid wifi is not available, by converting the Raspberry Pi into an Access Point.   This method follows examples from the [Resin-io repository](https://github.com/resin-io-projects/resin-wifi-connect-example)
For the Resin-io dashboard, two appliation parameters per device are needed to be sent to the Docker Containter.   
1. The GOOGLEKEY is the client key you get from google for a google maps account.  This is a good way to keep this private.   See instructions in the [BLOG](https://surfncircuits.com/?p=2665) on how to get this client Key.
2. The TIMEZONE paramater is the set to you time zone.  For example, 'America/Los_Angeles'.   See the entry at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones) for a valid timezone name.    

The Setuplocations.py is a python script that allows for each ETA clock to be customized for a given location and individual ETA destinations.   This will need to be run through the terminal window of the device as shown in the [BLOG](https://surfncircuits.com/?p=2665).  This data will be persistant between code updates.  Future upgrades of the code should allow this to be updated from a web server....
